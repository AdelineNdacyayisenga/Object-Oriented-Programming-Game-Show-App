# Object-Oriented-Programming-Game-Show-App
A browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter". Using JavaScript and OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard

Background color:
The main container background color was changed from white to a medium dardk shade of cyan-blue color, to make sure that when the user is playing the game, the onscreen buttons and phrase placeholders are more visible.
Changed the header color to a light shade of grey, to make it more visible after changing the overlay background color. 

Wiggle:
I added the wiggle animation to the 'Start Button' to indicate to the user that they need to click the button to get started. This will remove confusion on where to begin from.

Confetti:
I added confetti to the main screen, to add excited to for the player. It helped me practice CSS properties and what they mean.
